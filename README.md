# Airbnb Analysis
Introduction

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the Airbnb data extracted from Json file. Developed a Streamlit application for trend analysis, pattern recognition, and data insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Explored variations in price, location, property type, and seasons through dynamic plots and charts.

Features

Handling Null and Duplicate Values: Implement preprocessing techniques to address missing data and duplicates.
ETL and Dataframes: Perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to convert the data into structured dataframes for analysis.
Streamlit-based EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Performed Linear Regression to understand the variable dependenece on price.
Interactive Data Exploration: Utilize Streamlit to create a user-friendly, interactive interface for exploring Airbnb data.
Plotly Charts: Employ plotly charts to visualize key insights and trends in the dataset.
